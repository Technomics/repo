This project serves as an R package repository host. Packages in the
*costverse* can be installed from here rather than compiling from source
using `remotes::install_github()`.

For example, use the following to install
[costmisc](https://github.com/Technomics/costmisc/).

``` r
install.package("costmisc", repo = "https://technomics.github.io/repo/")
```

## Welcome to the costverse\!

The *costverse* is a collection of R packages, inspired by the
*tidyverse*. The goal is to create a cohesive ecosystem of R packages to
streamline tasks encountered by analysts in the cost analysis
profession. This can range from importing common data formats, working
with difficult data structures (e.g., a WBS), or applying more advanced
analytical techniques\!

The *costverse* began as an internal
[Technomics](https://www.technomics.net/) project to develop a set of
tools that enable our employee owners to solve our clientsâ€™ problems
more effectively. While aspects of the project remain internal, the
following packages are currently available to the public. You are free
to use them under the
[GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) - all that we ask
is to please cite us as the authors.

  - [costmisc](https://github.com/Technomics/costmisc/)
  - [readflexfile](https://github.com/Technomics/readflexfile/)

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions about what else is
in the works\!
